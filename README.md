# Welcome!

#### Objective of this Repository

The objective of this repository is to gather KQL queries related to the Microsoft Entra product family. The content of this repository includes KQL queries that I have needed in my daily work in some way, as well as KQL queries related to blog posts on my website [](https://www.christianfrohn.dk/tag/kql/). The hope is that other people can benefit from the content in this repository in their everyday work with Microsoft Entra

#### The intened use of this repo

The KQL queries in this repository are intended to either help provide insights into various actions or be used for monitoring in Microsoft Sentinel.

I recommend this blog post on how to run a Lifecycle Workflow based on an alert from Microsoft Sentinel: [Using Entra ID Governance and Sentinel to assure user alignment with HR data](https://www.christianfrohn.dk/2024/07/24/using-entra-id-governance-and-sentinel-to-assure-user-alignment-with-hr-data/)

Many of the queries will have this in line 2: // Usecase: Insights and/or monitoring alert via Sentinel/Azure Monitor. This is to help highlight the intended purpose for those queries.
